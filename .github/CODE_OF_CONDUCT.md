# Bridge Code of Conduct

Bridge is a community organization. We value the involvement of everyone in this community - students, instructors, corporate sponsors, and developers. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our program and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Bridge activities is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Bridge including, but not limited to, classes, email lists, and online forums (including GitHub). Instructors and corporate sponsors are expected to assist with enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it to Emily Robinson, Course Director (emily.robinson@rangle.io), Abdella Ali, Core Instructor (abdella@rangle.io), or Purvi Kanal, Core Instructor (purvi.kanal@rangle.io). All reports will be kept confidential, and will be dealt with promptly.


## Code of Conduct
Bridge is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:
- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All Bridge interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.
